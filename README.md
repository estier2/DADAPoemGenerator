DADA Poem Generator is a browser extension for Mozilla Firefox that transforms the website you are browsing into a dadaism poem when pressting the "Generate a Poem" button. 
It does this following the method of Tristan Tzara (Dada Manifesto On Feeble Love And Bitter Love (1920), VIII TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM) just without the siccors and bag:

    Take a newspaper.
    Take a pair of scissors.
    Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.
    Cut out the article.
    Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.
    Shake it gently.
    Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.
    Copy conscientiously.
    The poem will be like you.
    And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar. 

There is not really much to it.
